# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Module 7 - SQL

## Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to discover and review the number of employees at the Pewlet Hackard that are eligible to retire.
### Resources:
•	Postgres
•	ERD tool

## Results: 
•	There are 72,458 employees at the company that are eligible for retirement. This is a large portion of the workforce, making up 30% of the total 240,124 employees at Pewlet Hackard.
•	As you can see by the table below a break out of all of the individuals by title ready for retirement, 64% of these folks are in tenured/senior positions.
 

•	In the next table you will see the number if employees retiring by department – Development and production will lose the largest positions of their teams.
 

•	There is likely to be some issues with having enough mentors for this new generation of PH employees. We have people from a 4 year birth span retiring and are only allowing a 1 year span of mentors to replace them… so I think we need to widen the mentor age eligibility. With the current process there are only 1,549 employees eligible to be mentors.

## Summary: 
o	30% of the work force will need to be replaced to cover for the retirement of 72,458 employees. As you can see above the positions and departments that will be the hardest hit by this "silver tsunami".
o	There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. ~ 1 mentor for 109 employees… does not seem reasonable.
Additional queries that would be helpful to finding a solution are:
1.	Figuring out the optimal number of Employees to Mentors and expanding or creating a separate scenario of mentor eligible employees over a greater birth year span.
2.	Further analyzing the employees ready to retire and categorizing them into groups so they can essentially retire out in steps so not one department or type of employee/title all leave at once. Extra incentive may be required for this sort of plan.
3.	Start building a query to be proactive on the coming years of retirement so actions can be taken NOW to ensure the company is in a better position for this.
4.	Analyze which departments will be in the greatest need for additional resources and backfill to operate and focus on hiring there first. Clearly the technical departments will need to start hiring ASAP.
5.	Last is not a query, but I would recommend hiring better HR people so this doesn’t destroy the company.
